- 👋 Hi, I’m @e-Euler
- 🤫 Full time hacker.
- 🚧 I'm currently building my own security tools. The goal is to make them lean and simple for easy management.
- ♟️ I’m looking to collaborate on Security Projects
- 📜 I have achieved the Sec+ and CEH certifications. The CEH is the only one that is current. Currently achieving my HTB-CPTS. Eventually, I will get the OSEE.
- 🍰 My preference of work is Hardware and software. Networking is cool. Active Directory is fun to hack. Web Apps are despised.
- 🔣 Programming experience includes: C++, C#, VB, QBasic, Java, Python, Swift, PHP, ASP, JSP, and C. Scripting languages (i.e. bash) are in there too.
- 📨 How to reach me: I'm e-Euler pretty much everywhere.
